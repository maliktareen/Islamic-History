		The Prophet Is Born
One day, while travelling north, one of the Arab tribes from Mecca met a
hermit in the desert. Some of the men stopped to speak with him. Hermits
were known to be wise and the Arabs often asked their advice. The
hermit asked where they had come from. When they replied that they
were from Mecca, he told them that Allah would soon send a prophet,
who would come from their people. They asked the name of this prophet
and the hermit answered that his name would be Muhammad and that he
would guide them to a new way of life.
 Meanwhile in Mecca, Aminah, although saddened by the loss of her
husband, felt especially well and strong as she awaited the birth of her
baby. During this time she dreamt of many things. On one occasion it was
as if a great light were shining out of her, and on another she heard a
voice telling her that she would have a boy and that his name would be
Muhammad. She never forgot that voice but she told no one about it.
On Monday, the twelfth day of Rabi al-Awwal in the Year of the
Elephant, Aminah gave birth to a son. Allah sends man many signs when
one of His chosen Prophets is born and on that twelfth day of Rabi alAwwal in the year 570 A.D, many such signs were seen. Some were seen
by Jewish scholars who had read in their scriptures of a coming Prophet.
One of these learned men in Yathrib, for instance, saw a brilliant new star
he had never seen before as he studied the heavens that night. He called
the people around him and, pointing the star out to them, told them a
Prophet must have been born. That same night another Jew was passing
by the meeting place of the leaders of Quraysh in Mecca. He asked them
if a baby boy had just been born and told them that if it were true, this
would be the Prophet of the Arab nation.
Aminah sent news of the birth to her father-in-law, 'Abd al-Muttalib, who
was sitting near the Ka'bah at the time. He was very happy and began at
once to think of a name for the boy. An ordinary name would not do. Six
days came and went and still he had not decided. But on the seventh day,
as he lay asleep near the Ka‟bah, 'Abd al-Muttalib dreamt that he should
give the baby the unusual name of Muhammad, just as Aminah herself
had dreamt. And the child was called Muhammad (pbuh), which means
'the Praised One'. When 'Abd al-Muttalib told the leaders of Quraysh
what he had named his grandson, many of them asked, 'Why did you not
The Life of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 14
choose the sort of name that is used by our people?' At once he replied, 'I
want him to be praised by Allah in the heavens and praised by men on

After that momentous day in the month of Ramadan, Revelation came
again and again to the Prophet (pbuh). He understood now what he had to
do and prepared himself for what was to come. Only a strong and brave
man, helped by Allah, can be a true prophet because people often refuse
to listen to Allah's message. Khadijah was the first to believe the Prophet
(pbuh) and accept as true what he brought from Allah. Through her, Allah
made things easier for the Prophet (pbuh). Khadijah strengthened him,
helped him spread his message, and stood up to the people who were
against him.
Then Revelation ceased for a time. The Prophet (pbuh) was upset and
unhappy, thinking that Allah had left him, or that he might have angered
Allah in some way so that Allah no longer thought him worthy of His
message. However, the Archangel Gabriel came back to him and brought
this surah, or chapter, of the Qur'an:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
“By the morning hours, And by the night when it is stillest, Thy Lord
hath neither forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee, And verily the Last will
be better for thee than the First. And verily thy Lord will give unto thee
so that thou wilt be content. Did He not find thee an orphan and protect
thee? Did He not find thee wandering and guide thee? Did He not find
thee destitute and enrich thee? Therefore the orphan oppress not,
Therefore the beggar drive not away, And as for thy Lord's blessing,
declare it”. (Qur'an: 93.1-11)
The Prophet (pbuh) began to speak secretly of Allah's message to
those Who were close to him and whom he could trust. At that time
Mecca was going through hard times. There was very little food to be
had. Abu Talib, the Prophet's uncle, who had taken care of him after his
grandfather's death, was finding it very difficult to feed his large family.
The Prophet (pbuh) said that he and another uncle, al-'Abbas, who
was a rich man, would each bring up one of Abu Talib's children in order
to help him. The Prophet (pbuh) took „Ali and his uncle took Ja‟far.
One day, when the Prophet (pbuh) was outside the city, the Archangel
Gabriel appeared to him. The Archangel kicked the side of a hill and a
spring of water began to flow out. He then began to wash himself in the
running water to show the Prophet (pbuh) the ritual ablution to be made
before prayer. Then the Archangel showed him all the positions of
Muslim prayer-the various movements and things to be said with each
